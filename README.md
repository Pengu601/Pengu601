## Hi there 👋

My name is Nicholas Gonzalez, and I am an Undergraduate Computer Science major at UCF ⚔️. 

I am fascinated by all things Back-End, mainly focusing on Python and SQL!


- 🔭 I’m currently working on devloping a program called [SnapFormula](https://github.com/Pengu601/SnapFormula) that uses the snipping tool feature that automatically transcribes and copy photos of advanced math equations to the clipboard to paste.
- 🌱 I recently built a program to automatically download all files for specific or all courses, catering towards UCF students. Check it out [here](https://github.com/Pengu601/UCFCanvas-File-Downloader)!
