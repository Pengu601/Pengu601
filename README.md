## Hi there 👋

My name is Nicholas Gonzalez, and I am a Junior Computer Science major at UCF ⚔️. 

I am engaged in back-end development, working mainly with Java, Python, SQL, and AWS/MongoDB.


- 🔭 I’m currently creating a personal porftfolio website that will host all the projects I have created. This will be using a Java Springboot back-end with a React front-end.
- 🌱 I recently participated in the GemiHacks Hackathon, where my team and I created MindStream, a full-stack application which converts audio into an interactive mind-map. Check it out [here](https://github.com/skatari172/MindStream)!
